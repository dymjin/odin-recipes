        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lemon, zested and juiced</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 ½ teaspoons ras el hanout</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 (6 ounce) bone-in chicken thighs with skin</li>
            <li>1 medium sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
            <li>1 medium zucchini, cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can quartered artichoke hearts, drained</li>
            <li>¼ cup pomegranate seeds</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons shelled pistachios, coarsely chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine lemon juice, lemon zest, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 1/2 teaspoons ras el hanout, and 1/2
                teaspoon salt in a resealable plastic bag. Place chicken thighs into the bag, making sure marinade gets
                under skin. Seal and refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Remove chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before
                baking and let come to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine sweet potato, zucchini, chickpeas and artichoke hearts in a bowl. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon ras
                el hanout and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and stir to combine evenly.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from marinade and place on a 13x18-inch rimmed sheet pan. Place vegetable mixture around
                chicken.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven, flipping vegetables halfway through, or until chicken has reached an
                internal temperature of 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and garnish with pomegranate seeds, parsley, and pistachios before serving.</li>
